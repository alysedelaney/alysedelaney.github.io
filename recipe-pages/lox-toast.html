            <h2>The Best Lox Toast</h2>
            <p class="recipe-descriptors">serves 1, with seconds<br>10 mins</p>
            <p>I used to be a connoisseur of the best lox bagels in NYC. However, after going gluten-free a few years ago, I've had to mostly make do with lox sandwiches at home. For special occasions, I source my ingredients from the best-of-the-best in New York, including lox from Russ & Daughter's and bagels from my favorite gluten-free bakeries, Knead Love or Modern Love (so much love!). This might be a hot take, but when I'm at home I prefer making my sandwiches open faced.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 bagel, maybe 2</li>
                <li>Tomato</li>
                <li>A large spoonful of capers</li>
                <li>Onion, preferably white or sweet, but red will also do</li>
                <li>Cream cheese (If you're really going all out, Russ & Daughter's Horseradish Dill cream cheese)</li>
                <li>Lox, sliced</li>
             </ul>
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut bagel in half (if needed), and toast until nice and crispy.</li> 
                <li>Meanwhile, thinly slice onion. If onion is particularly strong (i.e. red onions) you can soak the slices in cold water for a few minutes and that will mellow them out. Pat dry when ready to assemble sandwiches.</li> 
                <li>Slice tomato.</li> 
                <li>Time to assemble the toasts. The order you place your ingredients is key— and also highly personal. My sister stands by the lox-on-top assembly, in which the fish acts as a blanket holding in the rest of the sandwich toppings. Unless I have top-grade lox that instantly melts in my mouth I prefer the reverse, starting with the cream cheese, lox, and the rest of my toppings. I like putting my capers on top for the visual, even if it means a few stray ones rolling around here and there. I'm sure that after a few lox toasts, you'll have your own tried and true order of assembly. Here's mine:</li> 
                <li>Start by smearing a generous (Really generous. Don't be shy.) serving of cream cheese on each toasted bagel half.</li>
                <li>Then the lox, draped ever so nicely…</li>
                <li>Next, place the onion slices…</li>
                <li>The tomatoes, sliced to perfectly fit the bagel…</li>
                <li>And finally, top with a heaping spoonful of capers and a healthy smattering of freshly ground black pepper. </li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
                <li>(Optional) Go back for a second sandwich, as is usual for Sunday mornings. </li>
            </ol>
