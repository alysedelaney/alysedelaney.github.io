            <h2>Fried Sole with Charred Corn Slaw</h2>
            <p class="recipe-descriptors">serves 2<br>approx. 30 mins</p>
            <p>My diet in the late summer consists almost exclusively of corn and tomatoes. This is one of the countless meals I made this year featuring the two ingredients when they were at their juiciest and sweetest peak. The simple fried fish and mellow cabbage provide the perfect backdrop for the produce to shine. For a hand-held variation, fry the fish in bite-sized pieces and add to grilled tortillas for a delicious fish taco.</p>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by charring the corn. Husk the cobs and remove their silks (â€¦oh la la). If you are lucky enough to have access to a grill, grill the corn cobs until the kernels are nicely darkened, but not dried out. Otherwise, if you're like me and live in a small apartment in the middle of NYC, you can place the cobs underneath your oven broiler, rotating them every few minutes until deeply charred over. Remove from grill or oven, set aside, and let cool.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, remove the core from the cabbage and finely shred it. (Tip: to shred the cabbage, you can use a vegetable peeler, <a href="https://youtu.be/qzZY7oDpdwU?t=136" target="_blank">like Maangchi does!</a>) Add to a medium mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>When the corn is cool enough to handle, cut the kernels from the cob, and add to the bowl with the cabbage.</li>
                <li>Add cilantro, lime juice, mayonnaise, and a good pinch of salt. Stir to combine. (You can also add a spoonful of sugar for a little extra sweetness, but the corn should do the trick.)</li>
                <li>Time to fry the fish! Lightly season the filets with salt and pepper. Dredge in the flour, making sure to shake off excess.</li>
                <li>Add vegetable oil to a shallow frying pan and bring up to a high heat. When a drop of water in the pan immediately sizzles, you know it's hot enough.</li>
                <li>Fry the filets for 2-3 minutes per side, until lightly golden brown, being careful not to overcook them. You may need to do one at a time. Place on a rack or paper towel lined plate to let the excess oil drain off. Season with one last sprinkle of salt. </li>
                <li>Plate fish with a heaping scoop of charred corn slaw. Serve with a sliced summer tomato, a squeeze of lime, and a generous drizzle your preferred salsa.</li>
