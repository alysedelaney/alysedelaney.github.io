            <h2>Gruyère and Caramelized Onion Pierogi</h2>
            <p class="recipe-descriptors">Makes approx. 50 pierogi (possibly more, maybe less, I always forget to count)<br>3hrs</p>
            <p>This was one of the first meals I started cooking regularly for myself after college. Back then I thought it was really impressive that it tasted like something out of the Whole Foods hot bar. Anyway, it's a great dish to make when you are craving something warm and filling, but also can't remember the last time you ate a vegetable. </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li class="ingredients-sublist">The Dough:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 1/2 cups gluten-free flour (Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 is the best! *But not the All Purpose blend* Whatever gluten-free flour you use should have Xantham gum)</li>
                        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>

                        <li>2/3 cup water, plus extra</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="ingredients-sublist">The Onions:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 tbsp olive oil + 1 tbsp butter</li>
                        <li>2 large onions</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup chicken stock (or vegetable stock)</li>
                        <li>2 tsp sherry vinegar</li>
                        <li>1 sprig fresh thyme</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="ingredients-sublist">The Filling:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>5 medium potatoes</li>
                        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
                        <li>1 block of gruyere cheese, shredded</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="ingredients-sublist">For Serving:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sour cream</li>
                        <li>Fresh chives</li>
                        <li>Butter</li>
                    </ul>
             </ul>
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="ingredients-sublist">First, prepare the onions:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Roughly chop onions into 1/2” sized pieces.</li> 
                        <li>Melt olive oil and butter in a pan over medium low heat. Add onions and a pinch of salt. </li>
                        <li>Once onions begin to sizzle, turn the heat to low. Slowly cook the onions, stirring frequently until they begin to take on a rich caramel color, about 45 minutes. You’ll be tempted to turn up the heat, but I promise, keeping it going low. It’ll make for much more tender and evenly caramelized onions. If time is precious, you can add a spoonful of sugar to speed up the caramelization. </li>
                        <li>Once onions are caramelized, remove about 1/4 of them from the pan and set aside. (You’ll be adding these to the filling, so you can also take more or less, depending on what you’d like and the size of your potatoes). </li>
                        <li>Turn the heat back up to medium, and add the 1/4 cup chicken stock, 2 tsp sherry vinegar, and fresh thyme sprig. Bring up to a simmer, and reduce until the sauce thickens and nicely coats the onions, sort of like a caramelized onion jam. You can do this again with another splash of chicken stock to really concentrate the flavors. The goal is to make a warm spoonable onion sauce to drizzle over the final fried pierogi. </li>
                        <li>Taste the onion jam/sauce and adjust for seasoning. Remove the thyme sprig. </li>
                        <li>When finished, set aside. Onions can be made a day or two in advance and reheated when ready to eat. </li>
                    </ol>
                <li class="ingredients-sublist">Next, make the filling:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Peel and quarter potatoes. </li>
                        <li>Add the potatoes to a large pot, cover with water, and salt them generously. </li>
                        <li>Bring up to a boil, and cook the potatoes until a fork pierces them easily, about 20-30 minutes. <em>Tip: Bringing the potatoes and water up to a boil together will help them cook more evenly. Also there's no need to worry, then, about accidentally splashing yourself with scalding hot water when dropping potatoes into it. Not that that's happened to me..) </em></li>
                        <li>When tender, drain the potatoes and add them back to the warm pot. The residual heat will help any leftover moisture evaporate from the potatoes. </li>
                        <li>Add butter and heavy cream. Using a potato masher, roughly mash the mixture together. </li>
                        <li>Add the shredded gruyere cheese and reserved caramelized onions, and stir. </li>
                        <li>Set aside, and let cool. Like the onions, the potato filling can be made a day or two ahead. </li>
                    </ol>
            </ul>
