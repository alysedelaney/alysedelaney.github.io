        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <div class="body_text">
            <p>This project asked the question: <em>How are digital components embedded in a cultural institution as large as the Met? And how does that affect the visitor and research experience inside and outside the museum building?</em></p>
            <p>Parts of this question were answered throughout the three sections: The Mediated Experience, Beyond the Museum, and Data at the Met.</p>
            <p><a class="body-link" href="mediated-experience/mediated-introduction.html">The Mediated Experience</a> explores where technology is embedded into the physical experience at the Met. It finds that in some cases there is seamless integration and in some cases there isn’t. In temporary exhibitions and more recently updated exhibitions the Met is experimenting with experience enhancing technologies like AR, and with placing QR codes throughout the physical space. But there are large sections of the museum where there is no indicated digital content and even the additional content that can be accessed is outdated and barely usable. However, there are clearly changes happening at the Met – they seem to have an agenda towards digital integration. But in order for that agenda to be successful they need to make more of an effort to make those digital materials accessible in the physical museum space.</p>
            <p><a class="body-link" href="beyond-the-museum/beyond-introduction.html">Beyond the Museum</a> explores what is available digitally at the Met, even if it isn’t indicated in the physical space. This section concludes that the digital exhibition experience that the Met offers is multifaceted and rich with educational material for students all around the world. But that those digital materials are unevenly distributed amongst the exhibitions on view – if one explores they are sure to find a large amount of information, but with a targeted search they will be able to find what they are specifically looking for. The museum is making an effort to accurately tag and connect different items, exhibitions, articles, podcasts, videos and other educational material. However, the museum’s website doesn’t always make it clear that this information is even available to search for.</p>
            <p><a class="body-link" href="data-at-the-met/data-introduction.html">Data at the Met</a> looks into the Met’s Open Access Program and the way it has stretched beyond only the museum’s website. The API has been utilized by students to render visualizations of items in the collection and computer scientists have even developed AI to automatically tag works of art with keywords. All of this makes it possible for the public to more effectively search the collection and lets the collection serve as a better educational and inspirational tool. But this section also illuminates that there is still a lot of room for improvement in regards to the search tool. Without prior art history knowledge of key words and eras it is difficult to search things within the collection. And even when proper keywords are used it still doesn’t always produce accurate results.</p>
            <p>Overall it seems like the Met is headed in the right direction, but it seems that when it comes to digital content they must expand their ideas of both who is using this content and how it can be used. Because <em>what is the point of having so much information available if people don’t know it exists or how to access it?</em></p>
