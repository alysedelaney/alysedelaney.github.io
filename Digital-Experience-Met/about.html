        <img class="headshot" src="assets/riley.JPG" alt="Headshot image of Riley Trist">
        <p>Riley is currently pursuing her Masters in Museums and Digital Culture at Pratt Institute. She is interested in stories – those that belong to her, to the people around her, and to those who have had their stories controlled and repressed.</p>
        <p>This fascination with storytelling manifested itself as a focus on art, illustration, and writing in her undergraduate degree at California State University, Northridge, where she had a chance to tell her own story, including writing and publishing a novel. However, when she was given both the opportunity to volunteer as an elementary school art teacher and to design exhibitions for galleries and museums around Los Angeles County, she saw that the way people’s stories are told is often manipulated by those who are in control of them. These experiences helped her transform her interest in storytelling and passion for other people’s stories into a way of giving people a platform where they are invited to showcase those stories.</p>
        <p>Riley is on track to graduate from Pratt in Spring 2024, after which she plans to pursue her Ph.D. researching internet culture, literature, and digital media studies.</p>

        <img class="headshot" id="headshot_tereza" src="assets/tereza.jpg" alt="Headhsot image of Tereza Chanaki">
        <p>Tereza is pursuing her MSc on Museums and Digital Cultures as part of the School of Information at the Pratt Institute. Still in her first year, she has developed a love for exhibitions; their planning, design, stories and visitors are each a source of creativity and inspiration. </p>
        <p>During her BA degree on Enlgish and History at the University of Nottingham, Tereza discovered the power museums hold within their local but also global communities. Through volunteering first and working later, she gathered experience in multiple museum departments and decided that the world of exhibitions is what she enjoys the most.
        Specifically, the digital element within museums is growing more and more, something that has peaked Tereza’s interest. The possibilites to enhance visitor experience through a mediated digital epxereince, as well as through interactive digital components within exhibitions are growing fast, and that’s something that Tereza is excited to explore both in her academic and professional career.</p>
        <p>Currently, Tereza is expected to graduate with her MSc on Sring 2024, after which she hopes to begin her career as a young professional.</p>

        <img class="headshot" src="assets/alyse.jpeg" alt="Headshot image of Alyse Delaney">
        <p>Alyse is pursuing an MSLIS degree at Pratt Institute, where she works as a Graduate Assistant in the Library’s Special Collections & Archives. She is interested in the intersections of archives, data, and collective memory. Her studies have explored the world of Linked Open Data in cultural heritage institutions and spatial humanities, and the role of embodied learning and oral history in culinary information behavior. Previously, she worked at Princeton University, where she managed the digital photography studios and provided teaching assistance to the Visual Arts classes. She has also worked at museums throughout New York City including The Frick Collection, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Rubin Museum. Through these positions, she developed her skills in cultural heritage imaging, digital collections, and library data management.
        </p>
        <p>She holds a BFA in Photography from the College of New Jersey and continues to make <a href="https://alysedelaney.com/" class="body-link" target="_blank">artwork</a> informed by her compulsion to document, preserve, and visualize her memories. She uses her dad’s Pentax K1000 camera to capture textural vignettes, curious portraits of strangers, and quiet memories of the places she has visited. Her favorite painter is Edward Hopper, and she is an avid home cook who firmly believes that food is the ultimate archive.
