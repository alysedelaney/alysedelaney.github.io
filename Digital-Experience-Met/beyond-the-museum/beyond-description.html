            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Both the Met’s website and its Google Arts and Culture page are filled with valuable digital content that is waiting for art and culture lovers to find it. This page will outline these two digital resources that the Metropolitan Museum provides to its visitors and the content they are made up of, through the two main frameworks outlined in the <a href="beyond-the-museum/beyond-introduction.html" class= “body-link”>introduction </a>: additional exhibition content and learning. </p>
            <p>To begin with, the Met’s website is understandably dense with information that covers its approx. 500,000 items. In order to access additional exhibition content from home, the simple “exhibitions and events” button is intuitively offered on the home page. There is a clear priority offered to temporary exhibitions which are the first ones seen on the <a href=“https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions” class= “body-link”>Exhibitions page</a>. After clicking on your preferred exhibition, in this example “The Tudors Art and Majesty in Renaissance England” exhibition, you are welcomed by a variety of digital content. Other than the quick overview of the exhibition, there is notably a linked pdf that provides access to all in-gallery labels. If you were to scroll further down, you would encounter a playlist with the full audio guide (and transcripts), as well as a full list and images of the artifacts found in the exhibition. Interestingly, at the very bottom of the page, one can find “featured media”, which includes two long-form video lectures and essays. At the same time, the “Visiting Guide” tab, though potentially meant to be accessed by visitors while in the space, offers a deep analysis of the exhibition that someone might prefer to access after leaving the museum. It includes an overview of each exhibition section and highlights from the objects. This structure is mirrored in the pages for all the other temporary exhibitions.</p>
            <p>Most significantly though, some exhibition pages include additional tabs that offer content that cannot be seen within the exhibition. For instance, within the Tudor exhibition, you can access the “Tudor Art in Motion” tab which includes behind-the-scenes content from the staging of the exhibition. Similarly in the “Hear Me Now: The Black Potters of Old Edgefield, South Carolina” temporary exhibition, the  “Audio Guide Contributors”  tab provides bios of those who made the exhibition possible, and in the “Lives of the Gods: Divinity in Maya Art”  page all information is also offered in Spanish. These additional tabs serve an audience that has created the time, within their home and through their personal device, to research and learn more about ongoing or past temporary exhibitions.</p>
